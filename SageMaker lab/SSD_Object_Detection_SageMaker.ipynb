    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an overview at how Amazon SageMaker effortlessly simplifies the machine learning development cycle for even the most complex of models, such as the Single Shot Detector (SSD) for Face Detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon SageMaker is a fully-managed service that simplifies the process of **building**, **training**, and **deploying** machine learning and deep learning models at scale. It consists of three components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Build**: A fully managed Jupyter Notebook instance for loading data, prototyping models, and launching training jobs and deployment endpoints. This comes pre-configured with all of the standard deep learning libraries for both CPU and GPU computation. \n",
    "* **Train**: With one-click, SageMaker launches fully managed, scalable training jobs on AWS for both proprietary SageMaker ML algorithms and custom-designed deep learning architectures.\n",
    "* **Deploy**: With one-click SageMaker provides a fully managed service for deploying trained models to endpoint instances to host model inference as an API call.\n",

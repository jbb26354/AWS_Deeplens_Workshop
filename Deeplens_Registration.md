### Step 2- Provide permissions

AWS DeepLens projects require different levels of permissions, which are set by AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) roles. When registering your device for the first time, choose **Create roles** under Permissions to have the required IAM roles created.

### Step 3- Download certificate
In this step, you will download and save the required certificate to your computer. You will use it later to enable your DeepLens to connect to AWS.

Select Download certificate and note the location of the certificates.zip file. Note: Do not open the zip file. You will attach this zip file later on during device registration.
